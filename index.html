			<p>Lions are very exotic creatures. Lions are the king of the Jungle.  They are a group of mammals that once lived in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Now they are only found in India and central and southern Africa. Though the lions look similiar, the two subspecies are very different in size, habitat, diet and more. 
		 The Asiatic lions tend to be much bigger according to the WWF.</p>

		 <p>Lions eat large animals that they hunt like zebras and antelopes. Lions are very social and live in groups called prides. The African prodes consits of three males and a dozen females. The asiatic lions divide themselves into two prides. One male and one female. </p>
